# Unibot

Unibot is a multi-functional assistant tool developed for PC shooter games. It simulates mouse input using various methods:  
- **Windows mouse_event functions**
- **Interception driver**
- **External hardware** capable of simulating a human interface device, such as an Arduino Leonardo or any Raspberry Pi Pico variant

Unibot can communicate with these boards through a COM port or a socket connection (Ethernet or Wi-Fi).

## Key Features  

**1. Aim Assist**
- Detects targets by analyzing pixels within a specified color range on your screen
- Automatically moves the aim towards the detected target

**2. Triggerbot**
- Automatically shoots when the player is aiming at a target

**3. Rapid-fire**
- Clicks rapidly to automatically shoot semi-automatic weapons

**4. Recoil Mitigation**
- Counters weapon recoil
- Supports multiple recoil systems:
  - **Point-and-shoot**: Bullets go where your crosshair looks
  - **Offset type recoil**: Bullets go above crosshair

### Disclaimer
  
This is a hobby project and intended for learning purposes only. I do not condone cheating in any regard. 

If you are using Unibot to cheat, please take a moment to reflect on why. Cheating ruins competitive integrity, undermines genuine achievement, and leaves you feeling just as empty as before.
